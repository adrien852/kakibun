# Kakibun ⛩

Sequel to KakiKana: Japanese N5 **sentences and grammar** as a journey across Japan —
100 grammar points in 10 arcs (Tokyo → Hokkaido), 500+ authored sentences, four exercise
modes (listen → assemble tiles, particle cloze, transform drills, read aloud), particle
and kanji-in-context explanations, SRS reviews, streaks, combos and mastery ranks.

## Install on your phone (GitHub Pages)

Serve this folder from the **same GitHub Pages site as KakiKana**, in its own
subfolder — e.g. `https://<you>.github.io/<repo>/kakibun/`:

1. Copy this whole folder into your Pages repo (e.g. as `kakibun/`), commit, push.
2. Open the URL on your phone and *Add to Home Screen*, like KakiKana.
3. After an update, open the app **twice** so the new service worker takes over.

## Kakikana link

Because both apps share the same origin, Kakibun reads Kakikana's progress
automatically from `localStorage["kakikana.export.v1"]` (once Kakikana is updated to
write it — planned). Until then, use *Réglages → Importer un fichier* with a JSON
export, or enable *Afficher tous les kanji*. Words whose kanji you haven't learned
yet are shown in kana; tap any word for its reading, meaning, and whether that
reading is the kanji's main one or a rare one.

## Release checklist

Bump `VERSION` in `sw.js` **and** `APP_VERSION` in `js/app.js` together.
No build step — the files are the sources. Adding a file means updating both
`index.html` and the `PRECACHE` list in `sw.js`.
